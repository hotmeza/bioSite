                <p> Sean Murphy, a 37-year-old from Buffalo, NY, found his way to Orlando after participating in the Disney College Program in 2009. Despite initially wanting a life in his hometown, Sean now works as a teacher in Orlando, where he enjoys sharing life lessons with students. He used to be a performer for seven years, but teaching became more appealing as he sought stability for his future family.</p>

<p>Teaching brings Sean a lot of joy, especially when students show interest in learning. He loves seeing the "nice" kids grasp new concepts, even though dealing with more challenging students can be tough. Outside of work, Sean's main passion is theatre, where he can truly express himself. He finds balance on stage, unleashing his creativity and energy.</p>

<p>Sean faced a tough time during his Disney career when personal and professional issues collided. However, with the support of close friends, he overcame these challenges and learned to appreciate the good things in life. Looking ahead, Sean dreams of making it big in theatre, whether on Broadway or through a humorous plan of marrying rich. Throughout his journey, his mom has been his biggest supporter, encouraging him to pursue his love for theatre. Overall, Sean Murphy is a dedicated teacher and dreamer who finds joy in the classroom and on the stage.
